# IOS_Form_Swift


The iOS app starts with a homepage that includes three fields for the user to fill out: Your name, Your Id, and a Start button. 

When the user clicks on the Start button, they are taken to a form page where they can enter their personal information. The fields on this page include First name, Last name, Email, Street address, City, Postal Code, Password, and a Submit button. 

Once the user submits their information, they are taken to an Info page that displays the data they entered on the form page.
